### **1\. Why DBMS?**

```
Guesses from class:
    - Big Data
    - Efficient processing
    - Reliable storage access
    - Efficient quick retrieval
    - Recovery from failures
    - Security and privacy
    - Concurrent access & update
```
```
Thoughts of professor: Sharing structured data (across users, apps, time and space)
                            - data cleaning --> analytics
                            - metadata/schema, structure, constraints
                            - logical and physical independency
                            - security and privacy (2 bases of security: authentication and authorization)
                            - transactions (concurrency control & durability)
```
